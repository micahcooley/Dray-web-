## 2025-05-18 - Environment Test Failures
**Learning:** `npm test` and `npm run lint` failed with module not found errors (eslint, ts-jest), likely due to incomplete dependency installation in the sandbox or network issues.
**Action:** Rely on code review and manual verification of logic patterns when the test environment is broken. Do not attempt to fix environment unless critical for the task.
